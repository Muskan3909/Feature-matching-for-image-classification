Description:
Reading the Images:

The script reads two images from specified file paths using OpenCV's imread function.
Convert to Grayscale:

The images are converted to grayscale using OpenCV's cvtColor function to simplify the keypoint detection and descriptor extraction process.
Displaying Grayscale Images:

The grayscale images are displayed using Matplotlib's imshow function.
Creating SIFT Object:

A SIFT detector object is created using OpenCV's xfeatures2d.SIFT_create function to detect keypoints and compute descriptors.
Extracting Keypoints and Descriptors:

Keypoints and descriptors are extracted from both grayscale images using the SIFT detector's detectAndCompute method.
Feature Matching:

A brute-force matcher (BFMatcher) with L1 distance is created to match pairs of keypoints from the two images. The crossCheck parameter is set to True to ensure that the matches are mutual.
The matches are sorted based on the distance between descriptors.
Drawing Matches:

The top 50 matches are drawn on a new image using OpenCV's drawMatches function.
The flags parameter is set to 2 to indicate that only the matched key points and lines connecting them should be drawn.
Displaying the Matches:

The image with the drawn matches is displayed using Matplotlib's imshow function.
